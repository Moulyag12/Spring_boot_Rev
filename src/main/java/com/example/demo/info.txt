@RestController :: is a Spring Boot annotation that combines:

@Controller ::  (used for web request handling)

@ResponseBody ::  (which tells Spring to write the return value directly into the HTTP response)

@GetMapping is a Spring annotation used to map HTTP GET requests to specific controller methods.

@RequestMapping(value = "/hello", method = RequestMethod.GET)
GetMapping is shortcut of RequestMapping

 Why Do We Need Model Classes?
Purpose	Explanation
Data Representation	--  defines the shape of the data your app handles (e.g., a Book with id, title, author)
Data Exchange --	It allows Spring to convert JSON ↔ Java objects automatically using @RequestBody and return data as JSON
Separation of Concerns --	Keeps data logic separate from business logic in the controller or service
Validation --	You can add validation annotations (e.g., @NotNull, @Size) to enforce rules
Readability & Maintainability	 -- Your code becomes much easier to read, modify, and reuse


@RestController
@GetMapping()
public class BookController ..... but why can't i use these two things?

@RestController	Class	---  Declares that the class will handle HTTP requests and return JSON
@RequestMapping	Class/Method ---	Sets a base URL path or maps to HTTP methods
@GetMapping, @PostMapping	--- Method ONLY	Handle specific HTTP verbs like GET or POST

Annotation	        Purpose	                                  Example URL
@PostMapping	    Create resource	                          POST /books
@GetMapping	        Get resource(s)	                          GET /books or /books/1
@PutMapping	        Update resource	                          PUT /books/3
@DeleteMapping	    Delete resource	                          DELETE /books/3
@PathVariable	    Extract variable from URL	              @PathVariable int id
@RequestBody	    Deserialize JSON from request body	      @RequestBody Book book


@Entity -- Java class that to be mapped to the table in the database.
@Id -- Afield or property inside an Entity
@GeneratedValue -- Stratagy applied to the @Id field
Database auto generate the primary key values

GeneratedValue.IDENTITY--Auto increment column(MYSQL,H2)
GeneratedValue.SEQUENCE -- DB Sequence
GeneratedValue.AUTO -- JPA Chooses best option

why to use repository layer?
1.Seperation
business logic in service layer,data access logic in repository keep code clean and testable
2.Abstraction over SQL
You interact with domain objects (Book, User) instead of writing raw SELECT, INSERT, etc.
3.Built in CRUD Patterns
Repositories give you a standard set of operations (save, findById, delete, …) you don’t have to write repeatedly

BookController
This class lives in the web layer. Its only job is to handle HTTP traffic: map endpoints like GET /books or POST /books, read path variables and request bodies, and return JSON responses with the right status codes.
 It should contain no database calls or business rules—just translate the web request into a service call and translate the service result back into an HTTP response.

BookService (interface)
The service interface defines the business‑logic contract for working with books: methods such as getAllBooks(), addBook(Book), updateBook(int, Book), and deleteBook(int). 
Because it is only an interface, it contains no code—just the method signatures. Having this abstraction lets other parts of the application depend on “what a book service can do” without caring how it does it, which makes unit testing and future refactoring far easier.

BookServiceImpl (implementation class)
This class sits in the service (business) layer and implements every method declared in BookService. Here you put the real business logic: validations, calculations, conditional flows, and all calls to the repository.
For example, updateBook might verify that a title is unique before saving. If you later need a caching layer or a remote microservice call, you can create another implementation (or extend this one) without touching the controller.

BookRepository
The repository belongs to the data‑access layer. Because it extends Spring Data JPA’s JpaRepository,
Spring autogenerates the code that actually talks to the database. The repository offers simple CRUD operations plus any custom query methods you declare.
By isolating persistence logic here, you can switch from, say, a PostgreSQL database to MongoDB with minimal impact—only the repository layer would change, while controllers and services stay intact.


@NotBlank - It ensures the JSON field isn’t null, empty, or just whitespace.

@Size - It limits the length, adjust to your requirements.

When you annotate your controller method with @Valid, Spring will validate the Book payload before the service layer:

If validation fails, MethodArgumentNotValidException is thrown and caught by your @RestControllerAdvice, which returns a tidy error JSON
